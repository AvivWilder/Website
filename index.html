    <h2><b><u></u>Week 1: August 21st - 25th<u></u></b></h2>
    <h3>This week, we learned about how to be safe in an engineering<br>
    environment,what the engineering process looks like, and<br>the basics of Rube Golberg machines.                                    <body>

    Concerning safety, we<br>learned about all kinds of protective gear, 
    like gloves and<br>goggles, and how various tools are used.The engineering<br>process, 
    another topic this week, consists of seven steps.<br>
    Asking a question, doing research, imagining a solution to<br>the problem you want to solve, planning a design, 
    creating<br>a prototype, testing it, and improving it based on the<br>results. Rube Goldberg machines, another focus, are large,<br>chain reactions made
    to carry out simple tasks. We were<br>given a project where we must make a Rube Goldberg machine<br>that starts with a baseball, 
    and ends with popping a<br>balloon. We made initial sketches of our design in our <br>groups, and we will do more designing the following week.
    <br>We also began our websites, which is what you are reading <br>right now.<hr></h3>

    <h3>
        This week, we did more work on the design of our Rube <br>Goldberg machines.
        My group and I each drew sketches and <br>then combined what we liked into one big sketch.
        We then <br>used an online program called Tinkercad to create a 3D <br>model (to scale) of our project idea. It is 
        still a work <br>in progress, but we should be able to finish it next week. <br>We also learned about mechanical engineering, which is 
        <br>one of the oldest and most broad disciplines of engineering. <br>Mechanical engineering is present in so many different <br>fields, like fluid mechanics, 
        thermodynamics, and <br>structural analysis. It combines elements of math and <br>physics, along with matrial science. We also did a challenge<br> this week!
        We had to use Tinkercad to create a home <br>appliance, and we only had 40 minutes to do so. I created a <br>bed, with a mattress, 
        a blanket, and a few pillows <br>(see image). Lastly, we took a quiz about safety in <br>engineering.
