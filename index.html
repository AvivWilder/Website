        This week, we learned about how to be safe in an engineering<br>
    environment,what the engineering process looks like, and<br>the basics of Rube Golberg machines.                                    
    Concerning safety, we                            <br>learned about all kinds of protective gear, 
    like gloves and<br>goggles, and how various tools are used.The engineering<br>process, 
    another topic this week, consists of seven steps.<br>
    Asking a question, doing research, imagining a solution to<br>the problem you want to solve, planning a design, 
    creating<br>a prototype, testing it, and improving it based on the<br>results. Rube Goldberg machines, another focus, are large,<br>chain reactions made
    to carry out simple tasks. We were<br>given a project where we must make a Rube Goldberg machine<br>that starts with a baseball, 
    and ends with popping a<br>balloon. We made initial sketches of our design in our <br>groups, and we will do more designing the following week.
    <br>We also began our websites, which is what you are reading <br>right now. <br>                                           <hr></h3>

        This week, we did more work on the design of our Rube <br>Goldberg machines.
        My group and I each drew sketches and <br>then combined what we liked into one big sketch.
        We then <br>used an online program called Tinkercad to create a 3D <br>model (to scale) of our project idea. It is 
        still a work <br>in progress, but we should be able to finish it next week. <br>We also learned about mechanical engineering, which is 
        <br>one of the oldest and most broad disciplines of engineering. <br>Mechanical engineering is present in so many different <br>fields, like fluid mechanics, 
        thermodynamics, and <br>structural analysis. It combines elements of math and <br>physics, along with matrial science. We also did a challenge<br> this week!
        We had to use Tinkercad to create a home <br>appliance, and we only had 40 minutes to do so. I created a <br>bed, with a mattress, 
        a blanket, and a few pillows <br>(see image). Lastly, we took a quiz about safety in <br>engineering.<br>

      This week, we finished our Rube Goldberg designs on <br>Tinkercad. My group and I felt fairly confident about our <br>design, 
      and we got to startbuilding! We began by cutting <br>out pieces of cardboard with a boxcutter, and taping them <br>together. 
      As of now, we have assembled our first ramp, <br>and it stands up on its own. We believe that
      our Rube <br>Goldberg Machine will end up smaller 
      than our 3D model, <br>but are confident that it will pop the balloon. Our machine <br>will be tested in a week,
      and the elements we still need <br>to add are the baseball stopper wall, the lever, and the <br>ramp for the car.
      Additionally, we took a quiz about mechanical <br>engineering and what it entails based on what we learned last <br>week.<hr>

    <h3>
    This week, we spent all of our class periods building our Rube Goldberg machines. It was a process full of failure, making changes,
    and solving problems. The elements left to build at the start of the week were the lever, the ball stopper, and the car's ramp. We began with 
    the stopper, which had a lot of problems at first. It didn't have enough support and was barely anchored to the rest of our machine. We fixed 
    this by adding a triangular structure to the bottom of the stopper and taping it to a base plate that supported the entire machine. For the lever,
    we taped a flat piece of cardboard over a triangular prism which was mounted on a cube. Thus, the ball rolled down the ramp and landed on 
    the lever. After this, we encountered some more challenges. The lever simply pushed the back of the car into the air, and the car would stay still.
    To solve this, we added a little piece of cardboard to push the car rather than flicking it upwards. We also rounded out the bottom of the car's 
    resting place. This made it so that when the lever pushed the car, the resting plate would slant downward, causing the car to begin rolling. Making the 
    ramp was pretty straightforward, but popping the balloon with the needle (taped to the car) was surprisingly difficult. The needle kept missing the balloon or got pushed 
    back by the balloon. This happened during our test in front of Ms. Petrosian. The machine worked perfectly, but at the end, the needle missed the balloon,
    because it was pointed too high. We used some tape to lower the needle and tested it again. And...it worked!!! This project was very fun, and I look forward
    to more projects throughout the rest of the year. Below is a video of our project in action.

        This week, we did two challenges. The first was a building<br>
        challenge. We were given one sheet of paper, tape, and <br>scissors, and 
        had to make a flotation device to support<br>weights (scrap metal). We selected a certain amount of <br>weight for our flotation device, 
        and our goal was to have<br>it stay supported for 5 minutes. Whoever lasted 5 minutes <br>with the highest weight would win. For my design, 
        I made <br>a small square boat/container, about 3 inches on each side. <br>It had 1 inch walls on each side, help together with tape. I<br>chose 
        a very ambitious 97.2 grams of weight, and went <br>outside to test it. I put my boat in the crate of water, and <br>it stayed afloat 
        for... 12 seconds! It starting filling<br>with water right away, and sunk very soon after. I learned,<br>to my surprise, 
        that the best design was one with a lot of <br>surface area. Even an unfolded sheet of paper would
        make<br>for a better flotation devide than mine. The second <br>challenge 
        was a designing challenge. We had to design a <br>paper letter E, as best we could. Then, our design was given<br>to another student to 
        measure and cut out exactly as <br>written. If the design was missing measurements or didn't <br>add up, it would show in the paper E. We 
        then had to <br>grade the design we recieved out of 10. This challenge's <br>purpose was to show the importance being meticulous and <br>thorough with 
        our measurements. We also learned about <br>computer engineering. It is a cross between eletrical <br>engineering and computer science, and has 
        many <br>applications today. Consumer electronics, robots, medical <br>devices, and some military devices all involve computer <br>engineering. We also got 
        an overview of the various parts<br> inside of a computer (see image).

      This week, we learned more about computer engineering. We <br>discussed the various parts that make 
      up a computer and <br>what they do. The main circuitry is all connected by the <br>motherboard, which is a big, flat board. <br>On the motherboard, you will find 
      parts like the CPU, <br>the GPU, and the RAM. The CPU (central processing unit) <br>does all of the computing for the computer. 
      It often <br>heats up from all this work, and thus has a heat sink near <br>it. The GPU (graphical processing unit) does 
      graphical <br>mathematics and processes 
      images so the CPU has less <br>work to do. The RAM (Random Access Memory) stores short-term <br>memory/data. 
      Long term storage is done with SSDs <br>(Solid State Drives) 
      and HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). <br>Peripherals are input and output mechanisms such as <br>keyboards, mice, USB drives, (Input), audio, and video <br>(Output). 
      Data is stored in units on a large hierarchy. 
      <br>There are 8 bits in a bite, 1024 bytes in a Kilobyte, 1024 <br>Kilobytes in a Megabyte, 
      and so on, with Gigabytes, <br>Terabytes, Petabytes, etc. We also dissected a computer, <br>but unfortunately, I was absent for this.
