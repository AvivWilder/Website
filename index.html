    <h2>   <hr></h2>
    <h2><b><u></u>Week 1: August 21st - 25th<u></u></b></h2>
    <h3>This week, we learned about how to be safe in an engineering<br>
    environment,what the engineering process looks like, and<br>the basics of Rube Golberg machines. 
    Concerning safety, we<br>learned about all kinds of protective gear, 
    like gloves and<br>goggles, and how various tools are used.The engineering<br>process, 
    another topic this week consist of seven steps.<br>
    Asking a question, doing research, imagining a solution to<br>the problem you want to solve, planning a design, 
    creating<br>a prototype, testing it, and improving it based on the<br>results. Rube Goldberg machines, another focus, are large,<br>chain reactions made
    to carry out simple tasks. We were<br>given a project where we must make a Rube Goldberg machine<br>that starts with a baseball, 
    and ends with popping a<br>balloon. We made initial sketches of our design in our <br>groups, and we will do more designing the following week.
    <br>We also began our websites, which is what you are reading right now.<hr></h3>
